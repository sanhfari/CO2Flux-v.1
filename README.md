# CO2Flux-v.1
The CO2flux Plugin automates the estimation of vegetation indices and CO2flux (based on calculations in equations 1, 2, 3, and 4). The user only needs to upload the corrected images for bands 2 (blue), 3 (green), 4 (red), and 5 (near-infrared). As output, the calculated CO2flux index will be provided as a file.
